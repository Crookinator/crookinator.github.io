    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer with a passion for accessibility, and its positive impact on technology; enabling individuals to have opportunities such as education, employment, independence, and a general quality of life that would previously have been out of reach. I have a unique perspective on accessibility with regards to its relationship with technology due to having a degenerative retinal condition from birth which has resulted in a slow but continuous loss of vision.

    <p>
      I have learned to leverage a variety of tools and technology to support a full lifestyle. My passion for technology is grounded in how it may be leveraged to create life changing experiences for individuals facing many forms of challenges.

    <p>
      I am also a proud graduate of The Seeing Eye® located in Morristown, NJ, and am accompanied by Leyna, a Seeing Eye® German Shepherd guide dog. The impact Leyna has had on my life is difficult to quantify as she has helped provide me independence and enables me to take on many opportunities that were previously not possible. Through technology, optimism, education, and companionship I strive to share my story and knowledge to help individuals learn how they may leverage technology and other tools to live a similarly full and independent life.
